Machine Learning project: Detect Fraud in Enron Data. This project woks over two datasets, the ENRON financial data and the ENRON emails. These datasets are about ENRON emplyees. The idea is to build a model that will detect if a certain employee was part of the fraud or not, as pointed to by the investigations. The financial data is a numeric data, so regular machine learning techniques were used. The emails are textual data, so Natural Language Processing was used.
